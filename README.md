# Color-Match

We are a small group of three high school students trying to create a product that will help users mix paint.

When painting, different pigments are used to create color. When looking at the finished product, it is hard to discern what pigments were used to create a particular color. This is inconvenient for not only novice artists wishing to recreate a color, but also for art conservationists wishing to determine the pigments in a color without physically disturbing the piece. From a survey of 139 respondents, a total 86.3% wish that there was a product that would identify pigments for them to mix in order to get a specific color. In short: currently it is difficult to recreate a color without knowing the original pigment mixture that went into it. 

Our application uses a machine learning model to calculate the percentages of pigments needed to recreate a desired color. 

The image on the left shows the screen that lets you select a color. The screen on the right shows the pigment percentages necessary for mixing the desired color.
